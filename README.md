Web/Mobile Programming
- My first web/Mobile Programming class assignment.
- It has two folders. The first one is source which has the html filed named index.html
- The html file contains

```<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Title</title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
```
- Second folder is the documentation with the screenshot of my repository.
- This was created by Nikesh Koirala
